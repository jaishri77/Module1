2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input("Enter a string: ")
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
```
Enter a string: Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```

## Result
